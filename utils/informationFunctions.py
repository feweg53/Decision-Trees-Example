    This function calculates the entropy of the passed in col (column)

    To do this you need to:
    1 - Identify all of the unique states (values) - for dataframes we can all df[col].unique()
    2 - For each unique value, you need to calculate it's proportion (all proportions should sum to 1)
    3 - To obtain entropy of the total system, do the following
    4 - Multiply the proportion by log2 proportion
    5 - Do the above (step 4), for each of the unique values (states)
    6 - Sum the results of the above two steps (4,5)
    7 - Negate that sum
